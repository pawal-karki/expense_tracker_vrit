## Development Notes

### Email Verification in Development

Email verification links are displayed in the terminal console during development. In production, configure proper email backend in `settings.py`.

### Token Lifetimes

- Access Token: 60 minutes
- Refresh Token: 1 day
- Email Verification: 15 minutes

All list endpoints return paginated results with 20 items per page. Use `?page=2` parameter for pagination.

## Configuration

Key settings in `expense_tracker/settings.py`:

```python
# JWT Configuration
SIMPLE_JWT = {
    'ACCESS_TOKEN_LIFETIME': timedelta(minutes=60),
    'REFRESH_TOKEN_LIFETIME': timedelta(days=1),
    'ROTATE_REFRESH_TOKENS': True,
    'BLACKLIST_AFTER_ROTATION': True,
}
